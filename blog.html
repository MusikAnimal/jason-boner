	<h2>FEBRUARY 26, 2016</h2>
	<img src="images/blog/black-sabbath-022016.JPG" alt="Black Sabbath • 2/25 • Madison Square Garden • New York, NY">
	<p>When <b>Black Sabbath</b> first announced their performance at the iconic <b>Madison Square Garden</b>, it was supposed to be one of the final performances of their U.S. tour, and the last time they would ever play in <b>New York City</b>. I don't know why I always fall for the lure of the "farewell tour," but the performance has now become the first of <i>three</i> farewell shows in the immediate NYC area. For a band like Black Sabbath, though, saying goodbye even three times just wouldn't be enough.</p>
	<p>Starting off their set with "Black Sabbath," the first track from their debut album of the same name, the band launched into a performance of their greatest hits, noticeably omitting songs off of their well-received 2013 release, "<b>13</b>." While I would have liked to have heard a track or two from that album, it seems fitting that they would focus their efforts on playing the songs that made people love the band in the first place. Black Sabbath still has what it takes to put on a great show, and for a band with all of its original members in their late sixties, that is an impressive feat.</p>
	<p>If this truly Black Sabbath's final tour, they will be sorely missed. I imagine that <b>Ozzy Osbourne</b> still has a couple of solo tours left in him, and I look forward to catching those if he embarks on them, but nothing will touch watching the band that started it all.</p>

	<p><b>Setlist:</b><br>Black Sabbath / Fairies Wear Boots / After Forever / Into the Void / Snowblind / War Pigs / Behind the Wall of Sleep / N.I.B. / Hand of Doom / Rat Salad / Iron Man / Dirty Women / Children of the Grave / Paranoid</p>

	<a href="#Animal-Collective-0223201602242016"><h1>ANIMAL COLLECTIVE • 02/23 & 02/24 • IRVING PLAZA • NEW YORK, NY</h1></a>
	<h2>FEBRUARY 25, 2016</h2>
	<img src="images/blog/animal-collective-022016.JPG" alt="Animal Collective • 2/23 & 2/24 • Irving Plaza • New York, NY">
	<p>Fresh off the release of their new album, "<b>Painting With</b>," <b>Animal Collective</b> played two sold-out nights at <b>Irving Plaza</b>, a venue choice more intimate than their previous visits to <b>New York City</b>. This was my 7th and 8th time seeing the band, and just like each preceding tour, the shows offered a completely different stage design and setlist.</p>
	<p>The great thing about seeing Animal Collective is that every tour offers a  experience. They are always heavy on new material and offer only a small handful of old songs, the visual and sonic experiences are colorful and precisely parrallel; sometimes Deakin is there. It is an approach that seemingly is a recipe for destruction should the band ever put out a bad record, but considering the devotion of most Animal Collective fans (myself included), I don't know if it would really make a difference.</p>
	<p>Lucky for us, the new record is fun and translates well to a live setting. Ex-<b>Ponytail</b> member <b>Jeremy Hyman</b> fills in for <b>Noah Lennox (Panda Bear)</b> on drums, allowing Lennox, <b>Dave Portner (Avey Tare)</b>, and <b>Brian Weitz (Geologist)</b> to stand front and center behind their respective setups. The songs themselves were performed to near perfection, but what really blew me away were the transitions in between. Animal Collective always manages to turn their entire setlist into a single performance piece, mastering the art of going off on musicial tangents while always having a place to end up, and at the perfect time.</p>

	<p><b>Setlist (Night 1):</b><br>Golden Gal / Spilling Guts / Hounds of Bairro / Vertical / Daily Routine / Bees / Lying in the Grass / The Burglars / Bagels in Kiev / On Delay / Alvin Row / Recycling / Loch Raven / FloriDada</p>
	<p><b>Setlist (Night 2):</b><br>Natural Selection / Gnip Gnop / Hocus Pocus / The Burglars / Jimmy Mack / Daily Routine / Golden Gal / Summing the Wretch / On Delay / Loch Raven / FloriDada / Bees / Lying in the Grass / Alvin Row</p>
